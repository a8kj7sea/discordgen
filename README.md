# NitroGenerator - (Opera GX)

The Seruqx team proudly presents a Discord Nitro generator designed to effortlessly deliver Discord Nitro to your server via webhook. Explore additional settings and customization options conveniently available through the `config.yml` file.

To run the generator, ensure you have Java installed on your system:

1. Drop your webhook link in the file named `"url.txt"`.
2. Create a file named `"valid.txt"`.

## Please exercise caution when adjusting thread numbers. 😁

We recommend using the following command:

```cmd
java -jar discordgen.jar 22 7
```
